Disclaimer;

This project may contain sensitive topics on mental health disorders that may make some people feel uncomfortable.

We realize that there is a variety of types and extents of mental illnesses which we will not be able to cover due to time. We acknowledge that they exist and should not be ignored.

# 1. Background

The original dataset i.e. Life Expectancy contains 2938 entries with 25 columns by Marya Lebron while the second data set i.e. Global Trends in Mental Health Disorder contains 108553 entries and 11 columns by https://data.world/amitd. The data sets were obtained from Kaggle.

The 2 data sets used contain informative data from countries across the globe about;
1. Factors that affect life expectancy in men and women such as status of the country, adult mortality, infant deaths, expenditure, immunization coverage etc.

2. The prevalence of mental health disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, anxiety disorders, drug use disorders, depression, alcohol use disorders.

# 2. Objectives

The objectives of the analysis are as follows:

1. To explore how life expectancy compares between men and women for our selected sample data sets inclusive of developed and developing countries where the developing countries are within East African Community and the 5 developed countries are within Europe.

2. To visualize the prevalence of mental health disorders comparing and contrasting depression, anxiety, and alcohol use disorders across the sample countries in 2015.

3. To illustrate the relationship between eating disorders and BMI.

4. To show how the mental health disorders have an impact on life expectancy for both men and women.
